    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Since graduating college with a degree in Exercise Science I have switched over to IT.
I have always had a natural talent for computer science since middle school, but I never realized 
how important it is until I was in college. Currently, I work as a technician at Apple and 
am currently building my skills. My ultimate career goal is Business analyst. Some of my hobbies
consist of exercising, cooking, fashion/modeling, traveling, and being in nature.</p>

    <h1>Experience </h1>
    <p>I got the chance to do an apprenticeship working as a Jr. Business Consultant at The Babcock
& Wilcox company which was honestly alot because I was finishing up my last few classes of 
undergrad. Over the past 2 years I have gotten the chance to help work on an health insurance
application, hands on experience as a tehcnician with an expertise in Apple products, as well 
as learning how to navigate through and use different project management tools. I also have had 
the chance to work with highly experience individuals who provide mock interviews and scenarios 
to help me prepare for a big time job.</p>
